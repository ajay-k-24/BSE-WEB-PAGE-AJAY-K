#Gmailbox!
I am working on a gmailbox. My gmailbox is a mailbox that searches for new and unread emails. When it finds new emails it will raise the flag of the mailbox using a servo motor. This could be very useful for students who get emails all the time.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up the arduino editor, and the gmail trigger with adafruit io. I did this by going to zapier and setting a gmail trigger to connect to gmail. I then ran several tests to make sure that the trigger worked, by sending multiple emails to myself. I got some error messages but eventually, it worked.
