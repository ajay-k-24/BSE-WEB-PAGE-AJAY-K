Hi my name is Ajay, and I am working on a gmailbox. This is a smart mailbox that searches for new and unread emails. When it finds new emails it will raise the flag of the mailbox using a servo motor. This could be very useful for students who get emails all the time.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was adding all the modifications. I added an LCD screen that shows the number of unread emails, and I added a led light that blinks when there are unread emails. One thing I will work on after camp is getting the led light to turn off using a button. 


# Second Milestone
My second milestone was connecting the servo motor to the gmail feed, and installing it in the box. Now, when you get an email, the servo motor will go up, signifing unread mail. I complete the box, I cut off the backside, and then I hot glued the servo motor to the underside of the box. I then screwed in the led screen, that will eventually show the number of unread emails, Finally I hot glued paper onto the box so I could draw on it.

 # First Milestone
 My first milestone was setting up the arduino editor, and the gmail trigger with adafruit io. I did this by going to zapier and setting a gmail trigger to connect to gmail. I then ran several tests to make sure that the trigger worked, by sending multiple emails to myself. I got some error messages but eventually, it worked.
